# Order Microservice

This is the parent project that contains modules of a microservice deployment for the _Order_ domain context. The two modules contained in this project are separated into separate deployment artifacts, one for synchronous HTTP-based interactions and one for asynchronous AMQP-based messaging.

## Order Web

The `order-web` module is a web application that produces a REST API that can be used by consumers to interact with and manage domain objects in the `Order` context. _Domain Events_ can be triggered directly over HTTP, and will also be produced in the response to actions that alter the state of the `Order` object. This web service also provides built-in hypermedia support for looking up the event logs on an aggregate domain object.

## Order Worker

The `order-worker` module is a event stream processing application that listens for `Order` domain events as AMQP messages. The domain events that are generated by the `order-web` application are processed in this module. The worker is responsible for durable transaction processing for workflows that are required to coordinate asynchronously with applications residing in other domain contexts.

## Work-in-progress

This microservice is unfinished. If you're looking for a more polished and complete reference, please take a look at the _Account_ module in the parent project.
